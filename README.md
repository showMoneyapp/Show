## Show App

We initiate a Metanet sub-protocol which is called MetaID in May 2020, It is a protocol about the consensus of Decentralized ID and the storage of protocol data.

We hope that with more and more wallets and applications support MetaID protocol, the following MetaID goals can be achieved:

- Users only need one master private key on the BSV network to use all MetaID-enabled applications/wallets;
- The user's basic information and application/transaction data are recorded on the Metanet tree that he owns, so that the users' data has nothing to do with the wallet side and the application side.
- Different applications can access the same protocol data to eliminate the information isolated island problem;
- The data of different protocols can be combined with each other under the MetaID association, and the BSV application development work is greatly reduced;

We think that is a very important piece of the infrastructure of BSV, please visit [https://metaid.io](https://metaid.io/) for more info.

And there are more and more Apps that built on MetaID are coming up, such as [https://showbuzz.app](https://showbuzz.app/) and [https://metanote.app](https://metanote.app/), etc. They are all MetaID-enabled application.

So we think , based on MetaID protocol, we can build a global social center of the user, no matter what BSV app the user is using, if the user makes an interaction with another one, we can make a notification to that one by an APP based on MetaID, and people can social on it also. we regard the whole Metanet is a huge social platform, and we need an App to make the unify notification.

So we build up this App now, It is Show App.



Show App is a social app based entirely on MetaID, benefiting from the MetaID protocol, we believe it will become everyoneâ€™s social center. Not only can it provide you with a on-chain P2P encrypted chat function, it is also your BSV global notification center. For example, if someone sends you a private message in a metaid-based website, or gives you a Like on a Metaid-based app, or someone makes a donation with BSV to you, the Show App will send you a notification, and you can immediately chat with the the person who interacts with you in the Show App.

Show App is also a MetaID-enabled Applications center. You can use all applications that support MetaID in one App, and the number of MetaID-enabled App is growing fast.
